  "assignedLeads": [
    {
      "id": 6,
      "name": "New Lead",
      "type": "warm",

Main API for updating leads with complex business logic. Handles all lead modifications including outcome, status, and special actions.

#### Request Body Examples

##### A. Update Outcome (Requires Comment)
```json
{
  "outcome": "interested",
  "comment": "Customer showed strong interest in our services. Scheduled follow-up call for next week."
}
```

##### B. Update Status to "cracked" (Requires Cracked Lead Fields)
```json
{
  "status": "cracked",

  "industryId": 1,
  "description": "Enterprise software solution for manufacturing",
  "totalPhases": 3,

}
```

- **Team Statistics**: Updates team's completed leads count

##### Push Action
- **Type Change**: Changes type to "push"
- **Status Reset**: Resets status to "new"
- **Unassign**: Removes assignment
- **History**: Creates audit trail

#### Response
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",

## 🚫 DELETE Endpoints

- **Completed Leads**: Status changes to "completed" and type becomes "upsell"
- **Lead Management**: Use PUT endpoints to update status, not DELETE

---

## 🔄 Business Workflows

### 1. Lead Creation Workflow
```
Create Lead → Request Leads → Update Status → Complete → Upsell
```

### 2. Failed Lead Workflow
```
Update Outcome to "denied" → Increment failedCount → At threshold 4 → Archive Lead
```

### 3. Cracked Lead Workflow
```
Update Outcome to "interested" → Update Status to "cracked" → Create cracked_lead record
```

### 4. Completed Lead Workflow
```
Update Status to "completed" → Auto-change type to "upsell" → Update commission → Update team stats
```

### 5. Push Lead Workflow
```
Set action to "push" → Change type to "push" → Reset status to "new" → Unassign lead
```
