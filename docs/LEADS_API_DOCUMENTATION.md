{
  "outcome": "interested",
  "comment": "Customer showed strong interest in our services. Scheduled follow-up call for next week."
}
```

}
```

- **Team Statistics**: Updates team's completed leads count

##### Push Action
- **Type Change**: Changes type to "push"
- **Status Reset**: Resets status to "new"
- **Unassign**: Removes assignment
- **History**: Creates audit trail

#### Response
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
