## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Guards
- **`JwtAuthGuard`**: Ensures user is authenticated
- **`LeadsAccessGuard`**: Restricts access to Sales, HR, and Admin users only

### Access Control
- **Payment Link Generation**: Only the sales representative who cracked the lead can generate payment link
- **Payment Records**: Only the creator can view/update their own payment records

---

## 📋 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|

### 1. Generate Payment Link
**`POST /leads/payment-link-generate`**

Generates a payment link for a cracked lead, creates client and transaction records.

#### Request Body
```json
{
  "leadId": 123,
  "clientName": "John Doe",
  "companyName": "Acme Corp",
  "email": "john.doe@acme.com",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "country": "United States",
  "state": "California",
  "postalCode": "90210",
  "amount": 1500.00,    //phase amount <= remaining amount and remaining amount > 0
  "type": "payment",
  "method": "bank"
}
```

#### Required Fields
- `leadId`: ID of the cracked lead
- `clientName`: Individual client name
- `email`: Client email address
- `phone`: Client phone number
- `country`: Client country
- `state`: Client state/province
- `postalCode`: Client postal code
- `amount`: Transaction amount

#### Optional Fields
- `companyName`: Company name (if applicable)
- `type`: Transaction type (defaults to "payment")
- `method`: Payment method (defaults to "bank")

#### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Payment link generated successfully",
  "data": {
    "clientId": 456,
    "transactionId": 789,
    "invoiceId": 101,
    "paymentLink": "https://square.link/abc123",
    "squarePaymentLinkId": "abc123",
    "leadStatus": "payment_link_generated"
  }
}
```

#### Access Control
- **Authentication**: JWT token required
- **Authorization**: Only the sales rep who cracked the lead can generate payment link
- **Role**: Sales team, HR, Admin users

#### Business Logic
1. **Lead Validation**: Verify lead exists and is in "cracked" status
2. **User Verification**: Ensure JWT user matches the `crackedById` from the lead
3. **Square API Integration**: Generate actual payment link using Square API
4. **Database Operations**: 
   - Create client record with industry ID from cracked lead
   - Create transaction record with "pending" status and Square payment link ID
   - Create invoice record linked to the lead and transaction
   - Update lead status to "payment_link_generated"
5. **Transaction Safety**: All operations wrapped in database transaction
6. **Webhook Integration**: Handle real-time payment status updates from Square

#### Error Scenarios
- **400 Bad Request**: Lead not properly cracked, missing required fields
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid or missing JWT token
- **403 Forbidden**: User is not the sales rep who cracked the lead
- **404 Not Found**: Lead not found or not in cracked status
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Database operation failure, Square API failure

#### Database Tables Accessed
- **`leads`**: Read lead status, update to "payment_link_generated"
- **`cracked_leads`**: Read industry ID and closed by user
- **`clients`**: Create new client record
- **`transactions`**: Create new transaction record with Square payment link ID
- **`invoices`**: Create new invoice record linked to lead and transaction

---

### 2. Get Payment Details

## 🔄 Workflow

### Payment Link Generation Flow
```
1. Lead Status: "cracked" ✅
2. User Clicks: "Generate Payment Link" button
3. Form Opens: Client + Transaction information
4. API Call: POST /leads/payment-link-generate
5. Validation: Lead exists, user authorized, fields valid
6. Square API: Simulated payment link generation
7. Success Path: Create client + transaction + invoice + update lead status
8. Failure Path: Return error, no database changes
```

### Payment Completion Flow
```
1. Payment Link Generated ✅
2. Client Makes Payment (via Square or manual)
3. Sales Rep Confirms Payment Received
4. API Call: POST /leads/payment-link-complete/:id
5. Validation: Transaction exists, user authorized, status is pending
6. Update: Transaction status to "completed"
7. Trigger: Commission calculations and lead status updates
8. Success: Payment marked as completed
```

### Database Transaction Safety
- **Client Creation**: Industry ID from cracked lead, createdBy = current user
- **Transaction Creation**: Status = "pending", employeeId = current user
- **Invoice Creation**: Linked to lead and transaction, issueDate = current date
- **Lead Update**: Status changed to "payment_link_generated"
- **Rollback**: If any operation fails, all changes are rolled back

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. Industry ID Source
- **Field**: `industryId` in client record
- **Source**: Retrieved from `cracked_leads.industryId`
- **Not Required**: From form input (automatically populated)

### 2. Password Hash
- **Field**: `passwordHash` in client record
- **Value**: Temporary hash for payment link clients
- **Note**: These clients are created without full authentication setup

### 3. Transaction Status
- **Default**: "pending" for new payment links
- **Update**: Only by the creating sales representative
- **Audit**: All status changes tracked with timestamps

### 4. Square API Integration
- **Current**: Simulated API calls for development
- **Future**: Replace with actual Square API integration
- **Fallback**: Database operations only proceed after API success
- **Webhooks**: Handle real-time payment status updates
- **Payment Links**: Generate actual Square payment links
- **Environment**: Configure sandbox/production environments
- **SDK**: Use official Square Connect SDK for Node.js
- **Webhook Events**: payment.created, payment.updated, payment.cancelled
