## üìù 1. Update Lead (Main API)
**`PUT /leads/:id`**

Main API for updating leads with complex business logic. Handles all lead modifications including outcome, status, and special actions.

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | number | Yes | Lead ID to update |

### Request Body Schema

```typescript
{
  // Optional fields - send only what you want to update
  "outcome"?: LeadOutcome,           // See enum values below
  "status"?: LeadStatus,             // See enum values below  
  "type"?: LeadType,                 // See enum values below
  "comment"?: string,                // Required when updating outcome
  "action"?: "push",                 // Only accepts "push" value
  
  // Fields for cracked lead creation (when status = "cracked")
  "totalAmount"?: number,            // Required for cracked leads
  "industryId"?: number,             // Required for cracked leads
  "description"?: string,            // Optional description
  "totalPhases"?: number,            // Optional, defaults to 1
  "currentPhase"?: number            // Optional, defaults to 1
}
```

### Enum Values

#### LeadOutcome
```typescript
"voice_mail" | "interested" | "not_answered" | "busy" | "denied"
```

#### LeadStatus
```typescript
"new" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "payment_link_generated" | "failed" | "cracked"
```

#### LeadType
```typescript
"warm" | "cold" | "upsell" | "push"
```

### Business Logic Rules

#### Required Combinations
1. **When updating `outcome`**: `comment` is **REQUIRED**
2. **When setting `status` to "cracked"**: 
   - `industryId` is **REQUIRED**
   - `totalAmount` is **REQUIRED**
   - Lead must have `outcome = "interested"` first
   - Lead must be assigned to current user

#### Status Transition Rules
1. **Lead must be "in_progress"** before setting `outcome = "interested"`
2. **Lead must have "interested" outcome** before setting `status = "cracked"`
3. **Lead must be cracked** before setting `status = "completed"`
4. **Failed count tracking**: After 4 "denied" outcomes, lead is automatically archived
5. **Push action**: Sets lead type to "push", status to "new", clears assignment

- **Handle failed lead archiving logic**
- **Track commission rates properly**

### 3. Error Handling
- **Check HTTP status codes**
- **Handle validation errors**
- **Manage permission errors**
- **Process archived lead responses**

### 4. Security
- **Include JWT token in Authorization header**
- **Verify user permissions**
- **Validate input data**
- **Check lead ownership**
